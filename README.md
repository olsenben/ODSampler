# ODSampler Digial Audio Workstation
## For Hip-Hop Heads
I have been producing on Maschine by native instruments for 4 years now. I love it to death, but I always hated how it handled pitch shifting and time stretching, and no offsetting the pitch for out of tune samples. SUCH a pain. My original workflow was serrato sampler in FL studio, which was great, but I find most DAWS to be just way too busy and I needed a physical interface to work with which is why I switched to maschine mk3. Not willing to shell out for Maschine +, I could never take my drum machine on the road without a laptop so I started using koala sampler, but I hate hate hate touchpads. I do love the simplicity, so I decided to merge koala sampler and machine with just the simplest features and with an interface designed to be used with physical controllers. Basically I just wanted maschine with serato sampler style chopping and koala style looping, so I decided I would try to make it myself.
